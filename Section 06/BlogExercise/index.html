            <h2>Love, the Fulfillment of the Law</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Corinthians 13:4-8 Complete Jewish Bible (CJB)</strong>
                <em>Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful,
                not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered,
                and it keeps no record of wrongs.
                Love does not gloat over other people’s sins
                but takes its delight in the truth.
                Love always bears up, always trusts,
                always hopes, always endures.  Love never ends.</em>
            </p>

                The past two week’s I have been going thru some hardship but Father God/Yahweh has gotten me thru it.
                He’s been teaching me to love more and to not repay evil for evil but to defeat it with good.

            <h2>Love, the Fulfillment of the Law II</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>1 John 4:7–8 Complete Jewish Bible (CJB)</strong>
                <em>Beloved friends, let us love one another; because love is from God; and everyone who loves has God as his Father and knows God. Those who do not love, do not know God; because God is love.</em>
            </p>

            <p>This week I had a good friend tell me something that is so refreshing & loving. As other’s may know. Facebook can be a hot bed of strife and contention. I used to be so focused on beating people with the truth that it would cause conflict & strife even among believer’s.</p>

            <p>What my friend told me though is that <strong>“Even if you are right but if you are breaking relationship with other believer’s or causing strife then you are still wrong.”</strong> God values relationship more then correct theology.</p>

            <p>This week I’ve gotten to fellowship with other believers and it’s shown me that loving & doing life with others is very important. Which is probably why the Bible mentions not to forsake the assembly of the saints.</p>

            <h2>Love, the Fulfillment of the Law III</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Mark 12:30–31 Complete Jewish Bible (CJB)</strong><em>
                    and you are to love Adonai your God (Yahweh) with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength.
                    The second is this:
                    ‘You are to love your neighbor as yourself.
                    There is no other mitzvah (commandment) greater than these.”
                </em>
            </p>

            <p>I want to encourage everyone who reads this to practice love and to look to Yeshua Ha’ Mashiach (Jesus Christ) as the perfect embodiment of God. He was loving even to those who tortured & killed Him.</p>

            <p>I hope everyone who reads this comes to know the Living God/Yahweh, His only begotten Son Yeshua (Jesus) & the Holy Spirit.</p>
